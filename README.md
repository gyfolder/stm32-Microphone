# stm32-Microphone
using STM32F103C8T6 chip-based Microphone FFT Spectrum

In 2018-01-21 20:12, I was interested in Fourier Transform very much.
I thought Can I try do this in STM32 Microcontroller, then I was focusing on this project.\

The day of this project is 2018-03-04 19:29.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find some picture and videos which shows the operation of Project.
But in my head, I remember this project, So I'll soonly rebuild this!
